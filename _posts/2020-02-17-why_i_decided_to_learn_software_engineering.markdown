For many years, I have wanting to learn code due to my brother in law request. I started off with SQL Server development but my brother in law kept saying i need yo go into Software Engineering. But I've always was interested in code. That special something that causes me to lose track of time while doing it.

It is definetly time to get this coding in an expert level so i can finally get my dream job as a Software Engineer. I think that is normal though. Bills need paid so you work where you can. I'm more interested in Backend vs Front End but will take Full-Stack postion. Do not get me wrong, I like the Front End side but perfer Backend.
